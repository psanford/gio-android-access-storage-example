# gio-android-access-storage-example

This is a proof of concept example of requesting storage permissions on Android from a Gio app (https://gioui.org/).

This is based on code from:
- https://git.wow.st/gmp/ble
- https://git.sr.ht/~whereswaldon/gio-x/tree/main/item/haptic/haptic_android.go

Perhaps there is an easier, better way to do this. If there is, let me know!
